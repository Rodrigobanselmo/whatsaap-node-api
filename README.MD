## [](https://github.com/pranavms13/whatsapp-node-api#why)Why?

  

The main reason I decided to build this is that there are many developers who want to play around with Whatsapp API and use them in personal applications before getting/purchasing a Whatsapp Business Account API officially from Whatsapp.

- 🚀 Fast!!!

- 🔒 Does not touch user’s data

- 💰 Free! for personal use
